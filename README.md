## Description

This repository contains the work we did for the Lab1 of the course [sec-labs](github.com/mosser/sec-labs).
In `lab_1`, the files `readme.md` and `readme.pdf` contain all our answers to the questions.
Each step in `lab1/_code` has a `readme.md` file which contains a description of our work on the step 
and eventually some help in running it. 

What follows is a concatenation of the `readme.md` of each step, for presentation purpose.

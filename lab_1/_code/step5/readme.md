## Step 5

The Composition version of this step has been implemented in Step 4.
This directory contains a complete implementation of the different classes
of the given Producer/Consumer meta-model :

![P/C meta-model](https://github.com/gliboc/sec-labs/blob/master/lab_1/figs/reactive_model.png)

The code generation is partially implemented, as well as the application: since it is enough
to understand the Producer/Consumer meta-model, and we had already completed the FSM version and wanted to switch
to later steps, we figured it would be enough to leave it as is.
